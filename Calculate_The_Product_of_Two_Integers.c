// C code
//This program will calculate the product of two integer number to yield a third integer number.

#include <stdio.h>
int main() 
{
  /* Variable definition: */
  int x, y, z;
  /* Variable initialization */
  x=-6;
  y=4;
  z= x * y;
  printf("Integers (x,y) and (z) are : %d,%d,%d \n", x,y,z);
  return 0;
}
/* Notes:
Line number 10 “x=-6;” is a negative integer number.
Line number 11 “y=4;” is a positive integer number.
Line number 12 “z= x * y;” will return your integer number with the appropriate symbol if the result is negative, in this case, -24.

Want to input your values then calculate the product of the two integers? Change the integers on lines 10 & 11. Have fun!
