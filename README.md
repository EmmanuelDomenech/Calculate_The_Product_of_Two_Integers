Notes:

Line number 9 “x=-6;” is a negative integer number.

Line number 10 “y=4;” is a positive integer number.

Line number 11 “z= x * y;” will return your integer number with the appropriate symbol if the result is negative, in this case, -24.

Want to input your values then calculate the product of the two integers? Change the integers on lines 9 & 10. Have fun!
